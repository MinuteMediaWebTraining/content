### The concept of Modules and Packages
* Good authors divide their books into chapters and sections; good programmers divide their programs into modules.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Good modules, are highly self-contained with distinct functionality.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* [Why use modules? - Maintainability, Namespacing, Reusability (via npm and between your projects)](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-modules-a-beginner-s-guide-783f7d7a5fcc)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* [CommonJS (require) and AMD (import/export)](https://auth0.com/blog/javascript-module-systems-showdown/)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### The concept of [Modules and Packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages)
* A [module](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages#what-is-a-module-) is anything that can be loaded with require()
* A [package](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages#what-is-a-package-) - A folder containing a program + package.json
* Node package may contain [one or more modules](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/master/src)
* Dependencies - external code that your program is using
* Built-in modules (like http) VS external dependencies (like jquery)
* versions: [1.Semantic Versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) [2.semver calc](https://semver.npmjs.com/)

---

### NPM - [node package manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x03fjb2VlGY)
* Create packages
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Share packages
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Download and install packages 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Manage dependencies (dependency code is not part of the package)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Run scripts
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### node package manager (NPM) - Live demo
* create package
* install package (default, -D, ci)
* node_modules
* package.json & package-lock.json
* use package
* npm start & other scripts
* [gitignore](https://medium.com/@haydar_ai/learning-how-to-git-ignoring-files-and-folders-using-gitignore-177556afdbe3)

---

### node package manager (NPM) - Practice 1
* create new package clone-and-freeze
```bash
    npm init
```
* install and use lodash (create a file: index.js )
```bash
    npm i lodash
```
---

### node package manager (NPM) - Practice 1
* upload package to [a new repo](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/)
* Upload your source code, not the external lodash dependency (use **gitignore** to exclude node_modules)
* Clone to a different directory and install with npm
```bash
    npm i
```

---

### node package manager (NPM) - last notes
* Installing package globally
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Modifying dependencies manually (Don't do that)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

### Libraries and Docs: Learning to learn

1. Get an overview
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

2. Perform very basic task. popular libraries usually provide a documented "Quick start"
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

3. Make sure you know what you are looking for ([duck-debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) may help)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

4. Use google with keywords, general to specific (like: js, Handlebars, some task  / functionality)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Libraries and Docs: Learning to learn
Go to resources (here are some common results)
- Stack overflow - mostly specific and right to the point
- w3school - great for getting short and specific data
- MDN - very professional data, include reference for standard, specs, compatibility etc
- Item specific docs - React, JQuery, Lodash etc.
- Medium / Hacker noon etc. - Many posts / elaborated articles written mostly by professional
- github / npm - most likely will hold some docs or link to docs, and the source.



---

### node package manager (NPM) - Practice 2
* install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) globally
* add lodash (and use it in js file) by updating package.json manually
* add [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) as dev dependency
* add a ***start*** script which start node for clone-and-freeze.js
* add a ***dev*** script which start nodemon for clone-and-freeze.js


---

### node package manager (NPM)
* Introduce CDNs
* Open discussion: NPM (or other package managers) vs CDN vs Copy file to local

---

### Typescript - Why and What?
* TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript (compiles to plain javascript) 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* TypeScript is JavaScript with extra features
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* It's an open source project developed and maintained by Microsoft
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* No browser support (yet)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
[How does it looks like?](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/)
* Why using it?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* How to use it? (strict / loose)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Trying Typescript - [notes before you begin](https://tutorialzine.com/2016/07/learn-typescript-in-30-minutes)
* require Installing TypeScript package globally
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Involve compilation step (\*.ts => \*.js) - demo
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* [TypeScript definition files (*.d.ts)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21247316/7126139)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/<package>
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

### Trying Typescript - Practice
* Install typescript and ts-node globally
* Init package with npm
* Create index.ts with the following code
```ts
let tsString: string;
tsString = 'I am A string!';
console.log(tsString);
```
* create `dev` script
```bash
nodemon --exec ts-node index.ts
```
* Check there are no errors and nodemon is working correctly


---

* Install lodash
* Create 2 short functions using typescript and 
lodash [differenceBy](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#differenceBy). each will have 2 input arrays. 
output is a single array containing the cells which exist in array1, but not in array2.
* Functions:
  - Function 1 input/output: array of integers or decimals. when comparing - each number will be rounded to the nearest integer
  - Function 2 input/output: array of strings
* add test for your functions with different inputs.
