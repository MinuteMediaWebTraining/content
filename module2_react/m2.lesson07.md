### Prep
* [Redux Explain in a simple way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFryvdyMI8s)

### Agenda
1. The problem with large scale applications
2. What is Redux?
3. Let's Build Redux
4. Redux middlewares

---

### Problems when apps go large
* As application grows so their complexity
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Nested props are hard to maintain
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Multiple Components use & affect the same data (and each other)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Saving application state (for later load)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### What is Redux?

* A design pattern (based on flux)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* redux.js - A Library which implement that design pattern
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Idea is: let's manage single source of truth, in a predictable way
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Redux dictate how to store and change your data, in a loose way
(Has Principles and best practices, but does not enforce them)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### What is Redux? - scheme

<img src="./assets/redux.png" height="280px">

* [store](https://redux.js.org/api/store) - manage your stuff
* state - object represent app in a specific time
* action - plain object represent an event
* reducer - old state + action => new state


---

### What is Redux?
State
```js
let state = {
    items: []
}
```
Action
```js
store.dispatch({
    type: 'ADD_ITEM',
    payload: 'Tea cup'
})
```
---

### What is Redux?

Reducer (Pure Function!)
```js
function myReducer(state, action)(
    switch(action.type) {
        case 'ADD_ITEM':
            return {
                ...state, 
                items: state.items.concat(action.payload)
            }
    }
)
// return value will become the new state
```

---

### What is Redux?

Subscribing to changes
```js
  function select(state) {
    return state.some.deep.property
  }
  
  function myHandler() {
    const state = store.getState();
    const deepProperty = select(select);
    console.log(deepProperty);
  }

  store.subscribe(myHandler);
```

### What is Redux? - Rules

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Principles 1: [Single source of truth](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles#single-source-of-truth)
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Principles 2+3: [States are immutable](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles#single-source-of-truth)

```js
let state = {
    items: []
}; 
// mutable
state.items.push('Cup of Tea');
// immutable
state =  {...state, items: ['Cup of Tea']};
```
---

### What is Redux? - Rules
Best Practice #1: Separate data and UI state
```js
{
    items: [...],
    viewFilter: ViewFilterEnum.All,
}

```
---

### What is Redux? - Rules
Best Practice #2: Keep a flat data structure (like a database)
```js
{
    posts: [{
        id: 3,
        text: 'Lorem Ipsum'
    }],
    comments: [{
        id:44,
        postId: 3,
        content: 'nice post'
    }]
}

```
